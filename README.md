# 7T_invivoLaplacianSegmentation
Scripts for training the modified nnU-Net + Laplacian model on 7T MRI for cortical segmentation

# Setup

To set up the modified version of nnU-Net, first install nnU-Net V1 as described in the documentation: https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet/tree/nnunetv1. I have modified various scripts to incorporate the Laplacian solver in the nnU-Net framework. To train the modified network, copy the files in nnunet_modified_scipts to their repsective locations within your nnU-Net installation folder. 

The location of the different files is as follows:
